# organise me README
organise me is a time tracking system that is targeted specifically at people who need to track their time for billing purposes, like tax consultants and solicitors.

# User Stories
This site aims to solve for the following user stories:

1. As a tax consultant I want to be able to store a list of clients and the rates that I charge them per hour so that I know what rates were agreed with the clients.
2. As a tax consultant I want to be able to track how much time I have spent working on a particular client so that I can provide each client with valid invoices.
3. As a tax consultant I want to be able to see how much time I spend on a particular client so that I can manage my time more efficiently.

# UX
The design of the site is very simple and muted, it is a tool that the user can use to more accurately keep track of where they are spending their time, in order to make their billing/recording of time sheets more accurate and efficient.    

## Features
### Existing Features

1. Clients page allows a user to add a client name, client group and billing rate per hour. There is also a colour picker.
2. The Home page allows a user to add a client to the current day. Once a client is added, the user can click on the client and the timer will start to record how much time has passed. When clicking the same client again the timer stops. When clicking a different client, the timer on the first client will stop and timing will start on the new client.

### Future Additions
1. Would like to add total time per client to a dashboard page, to be able to tally up for the week how much time was spent on a client and that could then lead to automated invoicing as well.
2. Add in the ability to modify or delete clients.
3. Add in the ability to store more than one week's worth of data, i.e. include the date that the time is tracked instead of just the day of the week.
4. Potentially add in more granular tasks per client per day so that the user can see how much time each task is taking to complete, which will allow for better pricing for new clients.
